                <p>I am currently working as a Network/Systems Administrator for a company and I am looking to broaden my education into the Developer field.  I was born in Somerset New Jersey but moved to North Carolina when I was in 5th grade.  I graduated from High School in 2006 then I moved to Charlotte where I spent the next 9 years of my life going to school and working.  I came to the point where I wanted to move back to Raleigh which I did in 2015.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I enjoy watching football, hanging out with my friends, and taking my dog out on different trails for walks.</p>
